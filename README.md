## Introduction
Screw jacks have been widely used in various applications, especially in the automotive industry. This project aims to enhance the traditional screw jack design by integrating an electric motor, which allows for easier operation and increased mechanical advantage.

## Motivation
With advancements in technology, the need for efficient and user-friendly lifting devices has become paramount. This project addresses the ergonomic challenges faced by users when operating manual jacks, particularly for individuals with limited strength.

## Components
The main components of the quick lifting screw jack include:
- **DC Motor**: Converts electrical energy into mechanical energy.
- **Battery**: Provides the necessary power for the motor.
- **Two-Way Switch**: Allows for the control of the motor's direction.
- **Frame**: Supports the entire structure, made from mild steel.
- **Shaft**: Transmits power from the motor to the gear system.
- **Spur Gear**: Facilitates the conversion of rotary motion to linear motion.
- **Screw Jack**: The main lifting mechanism.
- **Bearings**: Reduce friction and support moving parts.
- **Metal Strip**: Provides additional structural support.

## Working Principle
The screw jack operates on the principle of converting rotary motion into linear motion. The DC motor drives the spur gear, which in turn rotates the lead screw. As the lead screw rotates, it raises or lowers the load attached to the screw jack. The integration of an electric motor allows for smoother and more efficient operation compared to manual jacks.

## Manufacturing Process
The manufacturing process involves several key steps:
1. **Literature Review**: Research existing designs and technologies.
2. **Material Selection**: Choose appropriate materials for each component.
3. **Fabrication**: Use processes such as sawing, welding, and drilling to create the components.
4. **Assembly**: Assemble the components into the final product.
5. **Testing**: Conduct tests to ensure functionality and safety.

## Advantages
- **Ease of Use**: Reduces the physical effort required to lift heavy loads.
- **Compact Design**: Can be easily stored in vehicles.
- **Electric Operation**: Allows for operation from a safe distance.
- **Quick Lifting**: Increases efficiency in lifting operations.

## Applications
- **Automotive Maintenance**: Ideal for lifting vehicles for tire changes and repairs.
- **Industrial Settings**: Can be used in factories for lifting heavy machinery.
- **Home Use**: Useful for various lifting tasks around the house.

## Cost Estimation
The total estimated cost for this project is **Rs 6000**, which includes material and labor costs.
